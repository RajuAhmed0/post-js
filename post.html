        <article>JavaScript can be used to create and run video games in the browser. The modern web has quickly become
            a viable platform for creating and distributing high-quality games. With modern web technologies and a
            recent browser, itâ€™s entirely possible to make stunning, top-notch games for the web. JavaScript is blazing
            fast in modern browsers and getting faster all the time. You can use its power to write the code for your
            game or look at using technologies like Emscripten or Asm.js to easily port your existing games.

            There are also many widely adopted game engines that you can use to develop games with JavaScript and HTML5.
            Some popular ones include Three.js, Pixi.js, Phaser, Babylon.js, Matter.js, and PlayCanvas. These game
            engines provide a range of features and tools to help you create sophisticated 2D and 3D graphics without
            relying on third-party plugins.

            A JavaScript program is made of a collection of instructions called "statements". A semicolon marks the end
            of a statement, and allows multiple statements to be placed on the same line. However, it is typical to
            write each statement on its own line to keep a program file readable.
